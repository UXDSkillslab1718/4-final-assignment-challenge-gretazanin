           <h3 id="1"> DESIGN FOR EMOTION </h3>
           <p> Design For emotion is a course aimed at preparing future designers to think about humans' emotions by working on the dramatic arch of a specific context. 
           </br>
           During this project, I focused on the emotion <strong>distraction</strong> and together with my team, I created collages, videos, storyboards.  </p>

           <img src="images/collage.jpg" alt="thuas"width="390" height="400">

           <div class="collage">  I chose to represent this emotion by making the distracted person sit on her own distractions. While all the other pop-portraits of Marilyn Monroe are blurred and not well distincted and represent the main characters duties/tasks/to-do things, the different one (violet) is the distraction itself, a weird-looking Marilyn Monroe that makes the main character go off-track. The textures with black background represent the tentacles, a tempting creature (feeling of agitation) that surround the main character. 
            Lastly, the hand gesture on the left side, which is a famous Italian gestures to communicate disappointment over someone elseâ€™s actions, represents the part of the brain that wants to take control of her mind and go back on track.   </br>

           <p> Among all assignments from Interaction Design, I decided to include the one that challenged UXD students to recreate an already existing website and make it better by using familiar patterns, interactions, etc.
           </br>
           The following images show some of the graphics I created for the website.  </p>

           <h3 id="3"> BESPOKE PROJECT </h3>
           <p> For this course, we were asked to create a memorable gift experience for our user. Activities consisted of: brainstorming, researching, creating user portraits, design visions, insights, storyboards, interviews, prototypes, wireframes, presentation, physical prototype and final clickable product.
           </br>
           Some examples of the material created during Bespoke:  </p>

           <p> During programming, UXD students learnt how to communicate through a new complex language: <strong>JavaScript</strong>. We had to complete some challenges, Click on the following urls to check them out: </p>
