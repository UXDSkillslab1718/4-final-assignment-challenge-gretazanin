           <h3> DESIGN FOR EMOTION </h3>
           <p> Design For emotion is a course aimed at preparing future designers to think about humans' emotions by working on the dramatic arch of a specific context. 
           </br>
           During this project, I focused on the emotion <strong>distraction</strong> and together with my team, I created collages, videos, storyboards.  </p>

           <img src="images/collage.jpg" alt="thuas"width="390" height="400">

           <div class="collage">  I chose to represent this emotion by making the distracted person sit on her own distractions. While all the other pop-portraits of Marilyn Monroe are blurred and not well distincted and represent the main characters duties/tasks/to-do things, the different one (violet) is the distraction itself, a weird-looking Marilyn Monroe that makes the main character go off-track. The textures with black background represent the tentacles, a tempting creature (feeling of agitation) that surround the main character. 
            Lastly, the hand gesture on the left side, which is a famous Italian gestures to communicate disappointment over someone elseâ€™s actions, represents the part of the brain that wants to take control of her mind and go back on track.
